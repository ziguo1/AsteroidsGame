# nested folder!?!?!

Used to store known working code for the desktop version of Processing. Code will be ported over to processing.js periodically.

## NOTE: Running on Processing 3

Processing 3 runs this sketch extremely poorly (<6 ). You may want to try running them under Processing 4, or by using prebuilt project exports under this repository's [releases](https://github.com/ziguo1/AsteroidsGame/releases). The latter is much more faster and optimal as opposed to running under Processing 3 due to the inclusion of the much faster Processing 4.
